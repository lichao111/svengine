#DONORDIST 0, 1, 2, 3, ..., 2^nploid-1; this is basically deletion or nothing
#RECPTDIST 0, 1, 2, 3, ..., 2^nploid-1; this is basically insertion or nothing
#IF DONOR is multiple and is providing sequence, a random one among them is chosen 
#IF RECPT is multiple and every in the multiple is receiving the chosen donor seq
#FOR HOMOZYGOUS EVENTS TO HAPPEN at nploid=2: 
#DONOR must be fix_3, RECPT must be fix_3
#And Sequence Content Should be the same for any donor sequence
#FOR HEMIZYGOUS EVENTS TO HAPPEN at nploid=2: 
#DONOR must be fix_1/fix_2, RECPT must be fix_1/fix_2
#And Sequence Content Should be the same for any donor sequence
#FOR FASFORGE:
#DONOR, RECPT, DONORFREQ, RECPTFREQ are not effective 
#their values shall always be fix_1, which are just place holders
